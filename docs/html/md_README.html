<div class="textblock"><h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The HomeBot family of home automation robots is a product line concept for ACME robots. The HomeBot system integrates best-of-breed individual robotic capabilities with each other, home automation systems, and humans. Rather than trying to make a single robot with a too-versatile set of capabilities, elevating its cost and complexity, the HomeBot system uses best-of-breed robotic systems working together and in conjunction with household systems managed by home automation to manage domestic environments from small to large.</p>
<p>The HomeBot system can include products such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>ButtleBot – automated butler services (answers the door, greets guests, provides tele-presence, takes packages, delivers objects from room to room, and more)</li>
<li>TrashBot – takes the trash out and down to the road for pickup by city services</li>
<li>LawnBot – keeps lawns looking fresh cut</li>
<li>WatchBot – patrols estate perimeters day and night from the ground or (future product) from the air</li>
</ul>
<p>The key to the HomeBot system is a ROS node that can interface one or more HomeBot robotic products with a home automation system, allowing them to interact bi-directionally; the robots can make requests of and send notifications to the home automation system, and the home automation system can make requests of and send notifications to the robotic systems. These communications take place through the ROS Actionlib, a non-blocking service interface well-suited for this type of integration.</p>

<li>[future] Travis Continual Integration</li>
<li>[future] Coveralls coverage monitoring (in development)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<p>At this stage of development, HomeBot depends on standard ROS components, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>roscpp</li>
<li>actionlib</li>
<li>std_msgs</li>
<li>geometry_msgs</li>
<li>move_base_msgs</li>
<li>message_generation</li>
</ul>
<p>In the future, integration with the Turtlebot Gazebo simulation environment is envisioned as a way to visualize and demonstrate HomeBot service robot behaviors.</p>
<h2>Status</h2>
<p>HomeBot has been developed to the point where it is a technology demonstration that shows what could be possible as an integration between Home Automation systems and service robots. Integration with an actual Home Automation system, and with physical robots acting in the real world, is a future effort.</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>This ROS package has been built and tested for the Indigo-Igloo release of ROS. In order to build and use it, you will need to have ROS Indigo-Igloo installed on your system, along with the ROS dependencies identified in the package.xml manifest file (roscpp, rospy, std_msgs, message_generation, actionlib). The instructions in this README.md file assume that you are familiar with ROS and the ROS catkin build system.</p>
<p>To add the Turtlebot simulation stack to your ROS Indigo Igloo environment under Ubuntu 14.04:</p>
<ul>
<li>$ sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-turtlebot-gazebo ros-indigo-turtlebot-apps ros-indogo-turtlebot-rviz-launchers</li>
</ul>
<h2>Import HomeBot into your ROS catkin workspace</h2>
<p>To import the project into your catkin workspace, clone or download it into the src subdirectory of your catkin workspace directory. Once this package is part of your catkin workspace, it will build along with any other packages you have in that workspace using the "catkin_make" command executed at the top-level directory of your catkin workspace.</p>
<h2>Major Components</h2>
<p>This demonstration system is heavily-based on ROS in its current form. ROS communications (services and the action protocol, which are themselves based on ROS publish/subscribe messaging) form the heart of the system. Custom services and actions are defined (see the srv and action sub-directories) for HomeBot use, in addition to using standard and commonly available message types (such as the move_base_msgs). A new type of subdirectory and file is added to this ROS package: the repertoire subdirectory, which contains the .rpt files that express behaviors as a series of operations within the HomeBot system.</p>
<p>In addition to ROS, the major components of the system are described below.</p>
<h3>HARequestServer</h3>
<p>The HARequestServer provides a way for ROS nodes to request services from a Home Automation system. Integration capabilities currently demonstrated are include opening/closing doors, turning lighting scenes on/off, and and lowering/raising window shades.</p>
<h3>HAHVAC Action Server</h3>
<p>The HA HVAC Action server shows how a goal-oriented Home Automation capability (setting heat/cool modes with desired temperatures) can be integrated into the ROS system. None of the currently demonstrated behaviors take advantage of this capability. It is more likely that it would be exercised by an indepedent routing operating on a service robot, such as the ButtleBot, which might use it if a room it was monitoring grew too cold or too warm and it was programmed to adjust the whole house temperature accordingly.</p>
<h3>HomeBot_Node</h3>
<p>The HomeBot Node is the behavior action server for the HomeBot service robots. When fully developed, an individual HomeBot_Node will be present in the HomeBot system for each HomeBot service robot. The behavior action server loads a Repertoire of custom behaviors for each service robot, then exposes the behaviors through a ROS action server. A Home Automation system, interfacing with the HomeBot system through a HABotBehaviorClient, can signal HomeBot service robots to perform behaviors either on schedule (such as taking trash out to the curb for pickup), or in response to sensors that the Home Automation system manages (such as a doorbell being pressed by a visitor causing a ButtleBot to answer the door, or a disturbance in the yard causing a WatchBot to perform a perimeter patrol.</p>
<p>The HomeBot_Node represents the major technology implementation in the demonstration package. It creates a HomeBot operation instruction capability. The operations are grouped together to form behaviors. Behaviors are grouped together to form a repertoire for each service robot. The behaviors are stored in a file, then loaded into working memory as a repertoire when the HomeBot_Node for a service robot is started up. Once the service and action clients have been started on the HomeBot_Node, and the repertoire of behavior has been loaded, the HomeBot_Node exposes the interface to its repertoire of behaviors through a custom action protocol that expresses a behavior as a goal, with a requested number of repetitions of the behavior to be performed. Once a requester has initiated a behavior in this manner, the HomeBot_Node executes the operation instructions in sequence to perform the behavior.</p>
<h3>HABotBehaviorClient</h3>
<p>The HABotBehaviorClient integrates a Home Automation system into the HomeBot system by providing a pathway for behaviors requested by the Home Automation system to be activated (as a ROS action protocol goal) on a particular HomeBot service robot. Once the behaviors are activated on a HomeBot_Node belonging to a particular service robot, the behaviors may act both on the robot (such as move_base goals that direct the robot to different locations), or back on the Home Automation system (allowing a behavior to perform tasks such as opening doors, turning lights on and off, or raising/lowering shades). It is this last capability that reduces the need for a highly-capable robot mechanism capable of operating in the human world. The HomeBot service robots actuate things through the Home Automation system when necessary, instead of having local manipulators capable of interacting with the wide variety of human to touch interfaces.</p>
<h3>FakeMoveBaseServer</h3>
<p>The FakeMoveBaseServer is a stop-gap measure created to work around a limitation of using Gazebo/Turtlebot on my development ROS VM. Transform publishing did not work properly, so navigation of the simulated Turtlebot was not possible. FakeMoveBaseServer provides a "move_base" action server that crudely represents what the real move_base action server provides with an actual navigation system. It accepts full Pose goals, but only uses the (X,Y) component. It initializes at location (0,0), then tracks/maintains state of its location as it is directed to different locations using move_base goals. It simulates a physical robot moving at 1 meter/second (can be changed in the source code), providing position feedback at 10 Hz from when a goal is requested to when the goal is reached.</p>
<h2>Demonstrations</h2>
<p>Two demonstrations are currently provided, with three different example ways of how to launch them:</p>
<ul>
<li>HomeBot_System_ButtleBot.launch: starts up a HomeBot system using a ButtleBot repertoire for the HomeBot Node.</li>
<li>HomeBot_System_WatchBot.launch: starts up a HomeBot system using a WatchBot repertoire for the HomeBot_Node.</li>
<li>HomeBot_System_uni.launch BotType:=WatchBot (or ButtleBot) - starts up the requested HomeBot system as above; this launch file is included in the HomeBot_System_multi.launch capability (below) with a different BotType argument for each HomeBot to be launched simultaneously.</li>
<li>roslaunch homebot HomeBot_System_multi.launch: starts up a HomeBot system with all available homebots, each in their own namespace; remapping ensures that the HomeBots can still reach the HARequestServer services "/ha_door", "/ha_scene", and "/ha_shade"</li>
</ul>
<p>Once a HomeBot system exists, the Bot in that system can be asked to perform behaviors using the ROS service "/ha_demo", such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>rosservice call /ha_demo "PatrolCW" 3 (tells a WatchBot to perform the PatrolCW behavior 3 times)</li>
<li>rosservice call /ha_demo "PatrolCCW" 2 (tells WatchBot to PatrolCCW 2 times)</li>
<li>rosservice call /ha_demo "AnswerFrontDoor" 1 (tells ButtleBot to answer the front door)</li>
<li>rosservice call /ha_demo "CloseForNight" 1 (tells ButtleBot to close down the house for the night)</li>
</ul>
<p>If the HomeBot_System_multi.launch launch file has been used to launch multiple HomeBots simultaneously, the rosservice call must be modified to include the namespace of the robot being tasked:</p>
<p>-rosservice call /WatchBot/ha_demo "PatrolCW" 2 -rosservice call /ButtleBot/ha_demo "AnswerFrontDoor" 1</p>
<p>Behaviors can be added to each Robot type by editing the repertoire (.rpt) file found in the repertoire subdirectory of the homebot package. New HomeBot types can be added by creating the name and a repertoire file to go along with it; for these the HomeBot_System_uni.launch file makes it easy to invoke them without creating a new .launch file specific to the service robot type. Note that the HomeBot_System_multi.launch file must be edited to add each new robot type.</p>
<p>The operations available for defining behaviors are currently limited to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>HADoor number action (0=close, 1=open)</li>
<li>HAScene number action (0=turnoff, 1=turnon)</li>
<li>HAShade number action (0=raise, 1=lower)</li>
<li>BotMoveBase frame_id posX posY posZ orientX orientY orientZ orientW (Quaternions, only posX and PosY are current used in FakeMoveBase, but all can be defined in the behavior)</li>
</ul>
<p>Creating new operation codes currently requires creating a new C++ class for that operation, derived from base class BotOperation, and adding the operation compilation instructions to the BotOperation::transform method. The activity of each operation is defined in the "execute" method for the operation. There is nothing limiting the types of arguments to the operation codes to be numeric; these were simply the easiest to implement quickly.</p>
<p>[Future work - provide the ability to launch multiple HomeBots in a single system invocation; requires remapping some of the namespace so that a single HARequestServer/HAHvacActionServer can be launched with multiple Bot nodes.]</p>
<h2>Testing using rostest</h2>
<p>Level 2 integration testing of ROS nodes uses the Google Test framework combined with the rostest tool to run the ROS nodes individually or in groups. This package uses the testing capability extensively, both for testing individual components and for testing combinations of components.</p>
<h3>Tests available</h3>
<ul>
<li>HARequestServer.test: Verifies the function of the HARequestServer node using a ROS test node to drive the HARequestServer node</li>
<li>HAHvacActionServer.test: Verifies the function of the HAHvacActionServer node using a ROS test node to drive the HAHvacActionServer node</li>
<li>BotBehavior_Component_Standalone.test: Verifies the function of multiple components that together make up the BotBehavior capability when they are operated without the ROS nodes that provide interaction support</li>
<li>BotBehavior_Component.test: Verifies the function of multiple components that together make up the BotBehavior capability when operated with other ROS nodes that interact with the components</li>
<li>Repertoire.test: Verifies the function of the Repertoire component, which depends upon the BotBehavior components; does not use any other nodes. THIS TEST HAS HARD CODED FILEPATHS in the Repertoire_test.cpp source code because no ready method was apparent to pass arguments in through the rostest/gtest execution framework to the code inside of the test macros.</li>
<li>BotActor.test: Verifies the function of the BotActor class (the behavior action server) in conjunction with many other components (BotBehavior, Repertoire); requires HARequestServer and FakeMoveBaseServer for testing. THIS TEST HAS HARD CODED FILEPATHS in the Repertoire_test.cpp source code because no ready method was apparent to pass arguments in through the rostest/gtest execution framework to the code inside of the test macros.</li>
</ul>
<h3>General testing instructions:</h3>
<p>The use of these test capabilities assumes a basic familiarity with the ROS sytem, including the rostest capability. Once the homebot package has been integrated into a catkin workspace, the following commands can be used.</p>
<p>To invoke a test at the command line: </p>
<pre class="fragment">- rostest homebot HARequestServer.test
</pre><p>The output from this command is placed into a specially formatted XML file. For debugging purposes, the output can be sent directly to the terminal using this form of the command: </p>
<pre class="fragment">- rostest --text HomeBot xxxxxxxxxxxxx.test
</pre><p>The rostest capability is baked into the package's CMakeLists.txt build configuration file. To build the test nodes, invoke the catkin workspace build command with the target "tests": </p>
<pre class="fragment">- catkin_make tests
</pre><p>To both build the test nodes and run the tests as part of the catkin build system, use: </p>
<pre class="fragment">- catkin_make run_tests</pre> </div></div><!-- contents -->
